# How to contribute to Ygen
#### Did you find a bug?
 - **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching trough the Issues
 - If there isn't already an open Issue open a new one. Be sure to follow write it
   And follow the Issue Bug template

#### Did you fixed a bug?
 - Open a Pull Request with the fix
 - Make sure you reference the Issue with the description of the bug
 - Provide a clear description on how you fixed the bug and what it caused

#### Did you added a cosmetic change?
  - **Cosmatic changes will mostly likly be not accepted** when submitted via Pull Request
  - But if you find an function or a variable which doesn't follow our naming sceme (funcAbcDefg instead of func_abc_defg) please create an Issue

#### Do you want to add a new feature?
  - **Introduce it via a Issue**, when it gets approved you can start working on it
    (You can start working on it right now without adding an Issue but then you're having the change that your feature will maybe get rejected)
  - **Then create a Pull Request**

#### Do you have questions about the source code?
  - Feel free to ask in our Discord Server or **create a Issue**

Thanks!
